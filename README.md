## Machine learning steps for Face Mask detection :
- Environment setting : download jupyter note book https://jupyter.org/ or go to google colab https://research.google.com/colaboratory/
- Step 1 : Data preprocessing : get the face mask image name and face coordinate from xsml file
- Step 2 : Data preprocessing : split different faces into different dataset in same image (there are three type of attributes : with mask, without mask and incorrect wearing)
- Step 3 : Data preprocessing : data imbalance handling (2000 in size for training with replacement) (500 in size for testing without replacement)
- Step 4 : Model structure : Using convolutional neural network but in different structure for testing (details you may go to codes)
- Step 5 : Model training and validation : 15 epochs and defining loading, training and validation function.
